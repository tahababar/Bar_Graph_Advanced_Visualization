# Bar_Graph_Advanced_Visualization
A Data Science Project


In this project, I used pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.pyplot to clean a dataset and then create a bar graph that shows the average number of votes in four years for a specific region. I added a horizontal line based on a general number of average votes and then used three colors to compare the votes per year, in respect to that horizontal line. If the number of votes per year lowered the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became blue. If the number of votes per year exceeded the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became red, and if the number of votes per year were same as the number of votes depicted by the horizontal line, the bar coloring for that year became white. In the end, I also added error bars that reflected the 95% confidence interval for the mean.
